Exposing CharmingKitten's malicious activity for IRGC-IO division Counterintelligence division (1500)

# Episode 1
Today, we begin exposing the Iranian APT affiliated with the Counterintelligence Division (Unit 1500) of the IRGC-IO, known as **Charming Kitten**.

## Leadership  

Heading this operation is **Abbas Rahrovi** (aka **Abbas Hosseini**, National Number: 4270844116), an IRGC official who has established several front companies in recent years through which he manages the APT. Over the years, he directed attacks against dozens of targets including:

- Telecommunications companies  
- Aviation companies  
- Intelligence organizations
- and more...  

The primary focus of this APT is on countries in the Middle East and Gulf region, including **Turkey, UAE, Qatar, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan** and others.

## Activities  

Under the guidance of the head of the Counterintelligence division, this APT has also targeted and tracked **Iranians both within Iran and abroad** who have been identified as “regime opponents.”

## Evidence of Operations  

The exposure includes:

- Official documents from the APT’s internal network  
- Employee photos
- Attack reports  
- Translation documents  
- Files from the APT’s internal chat networks (Issabelle, 3CX, Output Messenger)  

…and much more evidence proving their malicious activities.

These individuals believed they were operating under the protective cover of the IRGC — **today, they will be recognized worldwide as agents of the IRGC.**

# Episode 2

As we mentioned, every few days, we will upload more materials from the Charming Kitten network (Department 40) under the management of Abbas Rahrovi.

Before describing the new content we have uploaded, we would like to address several clarifications based on your questions:

- The unit responsible for intelligence gathering in the IRGC is called the IRGC Intelligence Organization (also known as IRGC-IO for short). Under this unit, there are several divisions, each with a cyber unit that serves the division's needs.
- In the cyber community, the term "Charming Kitten" is often used as a general term for the activities of the IRGC-IO without distinguishing between the various divisions.
- The Counterintelligence Division (Division 1500) operates under the IRGC, and as mentioned, Department 40 operates under it – this is the Charming Kitten whose disgraceful activities have now been exposed.
- For example, see reports on publicly available tools (such as BellaCiao and CYCLOPS) – these are malware tools used by the department. How do we know this? In the following episodes, we will provide information linking the publicly available data to the department's private reports.

The division utilizes the department's capabilities for its own needs (counterintelligence) – advancing cyberattacks against Iranian citizens, Iranian exiles ("regime opponents"), European, Israeli, and Arab citizens. All of this is to promote terrorist activities.

The files we have uploaded include:

- Additional attack reports (on government entities, civilian companies, media organizations, etc., in countries such as Jordan, Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and more)
- Daily work reports of department employees
- Department server logs (e.g., the AMEEN ALKHALIJ server, a website the department set up to recruit former government and security employees from the United Arab Emirates)

As we mentioned, we will begin exposing the identities of the unit's employees – one of the attackers from Karaj team we published in Episode 1 is called **Vahid Molawi (see the hours report) – his national ID number is 0323217087**.

Let's eliminate this APT once and for all!
