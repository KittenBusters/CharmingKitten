## Leadership  

Heading this operation is **Abbas Rahrovi** (aka **Abbas Hosseini**, National Number: 4270844116), an IRGC official who has established several front companies in recent years through which he manages the APT. Over the years, he directed attacks against dozens of targets including:

- Telecommunications companies

- and more...  

The primary focus of this APT is on countries in the Middle East and Gulf region, including **Turkey, UAE, Qatar, Afghanistan, Israel, Jordan** and others.

## Activities  

Under the guidance of the head of the Counterintelligence division, this APT has also targeted and tracked **Iranians both within Iran and abroad** who have been identified as “regime opponents.”

## Evidence of Operations  

The exposure includes:

- Official documents from the APT’s internal network  
- Employee photos
- Attack reports
